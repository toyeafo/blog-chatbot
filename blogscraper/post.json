Visual Builder is more than capable of building the exact same types of pages as you would achieve with the Classic Builder, and more.

We need to make sure our image has enough width to work on the 2500 widescreen whilst keeping anything important within the middle 1200 pixels as anything outside this width is at risk of being cut off on smaller screens.", "So with this in mind, we recommend creating header images that are 2500 pixels wide and approx 600-1000 pixels high (depending on your header height), remembering anything outside the middle 1200 pixels may be cropped off on smaller screens.", "What makes a good image?", "This actually depends on what content is going in your header. The majority of the time youâll have some text and possibly buttons within your header. Ideally, you don't want your text and buttons to overlay anything important in your image. This is especially important if you feature people in your image. You donât want a button or text covering someone's face.", "The best images for headers containing text and buttons will;", "Allow text and buttons to be displayed clearly", "Have the main focus of the image to one side", "Wide enough to allow for high-resolution monitors.", "Keep the main focus of the image within the middle 1200 pixels of the image.

Having clear space around the focus point of the image.", "Let's take a look at some examples.", "Example 1", ": Background image no text overlay. Here's our image we've uploaded. It's 2500x900 pixels.", "If the header were displayed on a 1024 pixel wide resolution screen.

This will always be problematic across different resolutions. Try and avoid having flattened images like this example. Separate the logo and the background into 2 separate images. Upload the separated background image as your header background image and insert the logo into the header content area. This will allow the logo to float on top of the background and be responsive.", "Finally", "You may not always be able to see what this looks like on a larger screen as you have a smaller monitor but knowing youâve set the width and height to account for all screens will safeguard your header designs.
